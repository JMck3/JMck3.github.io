Hi I'm Jen

I work full-time from home as a Virtual Coordinator hoping to gain skills in the coding world. 

I have just completed my first units in fundamentals of HTML and CSS and I will soon be commencing study of Python. 

My Portfolio is the first Project in my current course of Study. 

In my Portfolio I have incorporated use of:

<li>use of images</li>
<li>links to external social media sites i.e. Linkedin and Github</li>
<li>use of hover/focus/active for input and navigation items</li>
<li>responsiveness for mobiles, ipads, desktop etc.</li>
<li>a functional contact form</li>
<li>an about me page with an area for me to add information on future projects!</li>
<li>use of semantic HTML</li>
<br>
I hope to incorporate javascript elements in the future but not mandatory for this first project.
