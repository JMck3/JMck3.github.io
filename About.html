    <h2>I'm Jen</h2>
    <p>I am a mum, wife, full-time virtual coordinator. My work day includes logistics, cost control and financial reporting, transactional services, 
      data analysis, minor project work and lead team support. I work 100% remotely full-time and love it. I work with a technical team and have a 
      strong desire to extend my skill-set to include web development and automation. My focus is skills that are not location dependent 
      to support my ongoing plan to continue working remotely.  
      <br>
      <br>
      On a personal note - I love spending time with my family including my two dogs, 
      listening to music and podcasts, watching movies and tv shows (nothing beats a good murder mystery!), hiking, camping and learning new crafts. 
      As I am new to coding I hope to populate my page with my completed projects and experiences as they develop below.     
    </p>
